<p class='subtitle'>From Dial-Up Internet Service (DuiS) to Software as a Service (SaaS)</p>
<p class="tagline">Most companies have a linear history, a simple progression that has lead them to where they are today.<br />
Maybe it looks like the first half of a bell curve. Edgenet is not most companies.</p>

		<p>To understand Edgenet you have to know its people. Those who have always been there, as well as those who have come and gone and, in many cases, returned.</p>
		<p>You have to know how Edgenet is one of  Nashville’s earliest and greatest technology company success stories. You have to know the winding story of a company that has evolved and grown over 15 years. How its patented technology was there all along, way before buzzwords like “cloud technology” were being tossed wantonly into marketing copy ad nauseum. (Marketing Note: Edgenet is a true cloud technology company.)</p>
		<p>In 1990 Edgenet began as one of the earliest dial-up internet providers in Tennessee. After great initial success, Edgenet moved into developing configuration software when they saw more opportunity in a software product than hosting modem connections (thankfully!). And as the 1990s bloomed into the dawn of the internet age, fittingly a profound new technology ushered in the next era for Edgenet.</p>

		<h3>Early Software Innovation</h3>
		<div class="column-section">
			<p>m2o (Made to Order) was developed beginning in the late 1980s and patented in 1999, and thus a mature configuration tool was now ready for big commerce. The Window and Door industry needed this tool as all their orders were done manually, and Edgenet had it. Thus, partnerships were born with Lowe’s, Home Depot, Andersen Windows, Pella and many more.</p>
			<p>This opportunity was seized by early visionaries and tech pioneers of Edgenet, including Tim Choate and Ted Lessman. Tim is on the board still today, and Ted remains the principal architect on the m2o software. (sidenote: Ted is only ever seen in jeans and has only worn khakis to work once in over 15 years - we have a very awkward photograph to prove it.) The point is, the people who made this innovation and success happen in the beginning are still on the Edgenet team, and that through-line makes a difference.</p>
			<p>In 2004, a major step was taken by Edgenet, as m2o became a cloud-based, or Software as a Service (SaaS), solution. Edgenet brought this new computing method to bear in the marketplace, and what better place to start than with Lowe’s, a long-time and valuable partner.</p>
			<p>By being in the cloud, m2o was now leagues beyond the competition, and that position continues today.</p>
			<p>Edgenet has a longstanding and proven record of being at the forefront of product and data configuration technology. The goal has never been to be the tech trend of the moment, but to innovate and sustain lasting, meaningful commerce tools for real business - big business - on a massive scale.</p>

		<h3>Growth</h3>
		<div class="column-section">
			<p>Edgenet has not been immune to the rigors of modern business and the change that comes with those challenges. This is what makes the story so great.</p>
			<p>In 2005 Edgenet was sold to Liberty Partners. Later that same year, Data Services for Manufacturers was introduced, and as a result, Edgenet grew exponentially. From 2005 to 2010, 200 employees and an office in Waukesha, Wis., were added, and a new product line was solidified.</p>
			<p>Ezeedata was born, a groundbreaking product data tool that allows for incredibly complex sets of product data to be groomed, and fed to retailers and distributors. If the m2o configuration software is a little hard to understand for the layman, then a look under the hood of Ezeedata is the stuff of a Stephen Hawking-induced haze.</p>
			<p>Ezeedata, in simplest terms, makes selling products massively more successful and allows for much greater insight into a company’s business. This innovation resulted in partnerships with Google, Bing, Walmart, AutoZone and many others.</p>
			<p>Around the same time, m2o continued to grow alongside Ezeedata. In 2006 Edgenet released iCAT, a powerful catalog management tool, which allows m2o customers to bring products to market more quickly and accurately.</p>

		<h3>People Matter</h3>
		<div class="column-section">
			<p>In the age of clockwork mergers and acquisitions, how many tech companies still have their patent-holders and inventors on hand daily to maintain the product and foster new innovation?</p>
			<p>There were many key players in the early days of Edgenet. Steve Proctor was head of sales, and Tim Stafford ran operations. They both left the company and went to a little outfit called Oracle. There they made waves and enjoyed massive success.</p>
			<p>Many of the original team never left Edgenet. Adam Owens and Candy Foriest built customer product catalogs for m2o, and still manage them today. Robert Guisinger was making sure QA ran a tight ship and still does. Michelle Martin maintains Professional Services with the same fervor and diligence she always has. All of these team members and many others from those wily startup days are still with Edgenet. More on Steve Proctor and Tim Stafford in a moment.</p>

		<div class="column-section">
			<p>From 2005 to 2014, under the Liberty Partners group ownership, the philosophy became heavily focused on innovation. However, the business foundation was not properly reinforced to support those innovations.</p>
			<p>Such is the case for so many tech companies in those years, where the veritable gold rush and pioneer mentality exceeded simple tenets of sound business. You can’t blame them for giving it their all, but in the end this was not sustainable. Investors were weary, and opted to not continue working with the company. The end of any partnership is a trying experience, but survivable. Edgenet has not only survived, but prospered.</p>
			<p>You always hear in the sports world about a team that has been, historically, successful but has since lost its way. Their fans clamor for the team to return to what brought them to greatness. The soul of a team is something that spans players and coaches, and an intangible identity and spirit persists. In the same way, Edgenet has returned to its roots, but with an eye on the future.</p>
			<p>Back to Steve Proctor and Tim Stafford, who both left Edgenet shortly after the Liberty acquisition. They returned in 2014 and, along with a strong and committed team of investors in Tenth Street Capital, purchased the company. They helped Edgenet quickly recapture its original greatness - and did so with the energy and expertise that was key in building Edgenet in the first place.</p>
			<p>Steve Proctor is now CEO, Tim Stafford is EVP, and their savvy in the industries served by Edgenet are unsurpassed. Along with Chris Dowdy, CFO, who joined Edgenet from Asurion in 2014 with an incomparable track record, this executive team is primed to forge ahead.</p>

		<h3>A New Beginning… Sort of</h3>
		<div class="column-section">
			<p>A company couldn’t set out to have Edgenet’s current blend of new and storied perspectives, collective experiences, and industry knowledge. It is a natural outcome of the evolution of Edgenet. The true talent is in recognizing this rarefied blend of history and people, and leveraging it to support our product and customers. That is precisely what the new leadership has achieved.</p>
			<p>Edgenet’s products and successes speak for themselves. Some refer to the company as the “new” Edgenet, which in many respects makes sense, but the Edgenet of today is a rich hybrid of contemporary ideas and historical knowledge, which transcends the notion of just newness.</p>
			<p>You see, I too worked for Edgenet from 2000-2005, and then moved on to other adventures just as Steve, Tim and others did. But when Steve and Tim called me and said they were “getting the band back together,” who wouldn’t take on that challenge?</p>
			<p>Many of us are back, and excited to not just return to Edgenet, but to truly be in the present; to take these amazing tools even further and help businesses be more successful than thought possible in the modern idiom.
			</p>
			<p>How many times in life do you get to do it all again, but with what you know now? We get to do that.</p>
			<p>This is why Edgenet is a storied and compelling company, filled with inspired people, all with an unrelenting drive to succeed through our customers success.</p>
			<p>What do we do? We Design Data. We do that these days in the cloud, in real time, on any device, and better than anyone does it. No screeching modem required.</p>
